# ID1020-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

### Description

Project part in course ID1020 Algorithms and Data Structures taken at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The project includes laboratory work containing several assignments like usage of linked lists and hash tables, to sorting  arrays and computing paths between vertices in a graph. Fundemental data structures are used and variuos approaches are applied to solve the program in the most efficient way with respect to the resource needs of algorithms in the form of time and memory.

### Built With

- Java
- C

### Acknowledgement
